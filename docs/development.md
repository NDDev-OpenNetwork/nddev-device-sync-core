# Development workflow

Use the pinned toolchain and the repository's `just` recipes. Keep runtime
credentials, private estate data and live telemetry outside this repository.

`main` and `dev` are permanent branches. Make scoped changes on a working
branch, submit a pull request to `dev`, and promote reviewed changes from
`dev` to `main`. Use Conventional Commits and signed commits. Do not delete
permanent branches or rewrite published history.

The `NDS checks / quality` job runs on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu with read-only
repository permissions and immutable action pins. It checks this repository's
current foundation. A green result is not deployment, release, integration or
cross-platform acceptance. Full release gates remain those in the locked
central standards.

## Standards compatibility

The module standards lock remains at `v0.0.1-alpha.7` (`592531d`).
Central `v0.0.1-alpha.8` (`c73a525`) changes assembly catalog metadata only;
the normative `standarts/` files are identical. The older lock is compatible
with the current assembly. Update locks only through the canonical source
release, not through a mutable branch.
